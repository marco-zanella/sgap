Scala Gentic Algorithm Package

SGAP is my project for the Advanced Topics in Programming Lanaguages course at Universit√† degli Studi di Padova, Master degree in Computer Science.

SGAP aims to be the Scala equivalent to JGAP (Java Genetic Algorithm Package), although the original idea was slightly modified for didactic purposes. As a collateral project, SGAP also contain a small packages for greedy heuristics.

In this project great emphasis is given to the functional side of Scala, as some implementation choices are driven by the willing of stressing some concepts of functional programming languages. SGAP also makes use of many aspect of the object-oriented aspects of Scala, in particular traits.
