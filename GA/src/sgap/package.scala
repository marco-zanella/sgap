/** SGAP is a genetic algorithms package written in Scala.
 *  It is designed to require minimum effort to use "out of the box",
 *  but is highly modular and allows custom components to be easily
 *  plugged in by the more adventurous.
 *  
 *  This documentation was wildly copied from JGAP's web site.
